# DEEL BACKEND TASK

ðŸ’« Welcome! ðŸŽ‰


## Project Structure & Approach
- I have organized controller, routes, constants in separater folder for imporved structure.
    - Services for business logic, Factories for data formating can be implemented too if there is a big business logic.
- Data validation can be done too specifically for POST APIs.
- I have used Sequelize Transacation built-in functions for commit and roll back approach.

## Unit Testing
I have not implemented unit testing. But it can done using libraries like Mocha, Jest. 
- I ususally prefer to write unit tests for testing business logic first. 
- I use AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) for arranging and organizing unit tests.

## Getting Set Up

The exercise requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed. We recommend using the LTS version.

1. Start by creating a local repository for this folder.

1. In the repo root directory, run `npm install` to gather all dependencies.

1. Next, `npm run seed` will seed the local SQLite database. **Warning: This will drop the database if it exists**. The database lives in a local file `database.sqlite3`.

1. Then run `npm start` which should start both the server and the React client.

## APIs Implemented

Below is a list of the required API's for the application.

1. **_GET_** `/contracts/:id` - This API is broken ðŸ˜µ! it should return the contract only if it belongs to the profile calling. better fix that!

1. **_GET_** `/contracts` - Returns a list of contracts belonging to a user (client or contractor), the list should only contain non terminated contracts.

1. **_GET_** `/jobs/unpaid` - Get all unpaid jobs for a user (**_either_** a client or contractor), for **_active contracts only_**.

1. **_POST_** `/jobs/:job_id/pay` - Pay for a job, a client can only pay if his balance >= the amount to pay. The amount should be moved from the client's balance to the contractor balance.

1. **_POST_** `/balances/deposit/:userId` - Deposits money into the the the balance of a client, a client can't deposit more than 25% his total of jobs to pay. (at the deposit moment)

1. **_GET_** `/admin/best-profession?start=<date>&end=<date>` - Returns the profession that earned the most money (sum of jobs paid) for any contactor that worked in the query time range.
